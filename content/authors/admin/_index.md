I am a Financial Sector Expert in the IMF's Monetary Policy Modeling Unit in MCM. I work on model based analysis of monetary and maroprudentail policy.

Previously I worked as an Economist in the [Monetary Policy Strategy Division, Strategy Issues section](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/strategy/html/index.en.html) of the European Central Bank. My research focuses on expectation formation, monetary policy and DSGE estimation.

I was member of the development team for [Macroecomomic Model Data Base](https://www.macromodelbase.com/), a Dynare based macroeconomic model comparison platform.
